# Fraction-Arithmetic-Calculator
This C++ program demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles through the implementation of a Fraction class.

## Description:

Includes constructors, destructor, operator overloading, and exception handling for division by zero. Users can input two fractions, and the program will calculate their sum. It also keeps track of the number of Fraction objects created.
